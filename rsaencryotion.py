    Asymmetric key cryptography algorithm based ( public key cryptography and private key cryptography )
    RSA is a public-key cryptographic algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large integers (prime numbers).
    The algorithm is typically used for both encryption and authentication (digital signature).
